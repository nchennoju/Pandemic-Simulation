# Pandemic-Simulation

Coronavirus as of now has claimed over 30,000 lives and has now infected 664000 people (at the time I am writing this post). Since matters are not seeming to improve anytime soon, I have decided to get started in building a pandemic model using python.

I have not begun this project yet, but would like to lay down some rules/guidelines for my program. I have done a little research and have learned that there s something known as the SIR disease model. S = Susceptible Population, I = Infected Population, and R = Recovered Population. To keep things simple, I will start off omitting the R component and will later implement it into my program. This model is based off the assumption that those who have recovered from the disease/virus have developed some form of immunity, thus preventing them from getting the disease/virus again. I plan to use python to write my program and will post the project online for anyone to try. My goal is to understand how different strategies could be used to reduce the maximum number of people who have contracted the virus at any given time. Since this will be a simulation, time will be sped up and movement of each person will be randomized.

Considering that the pandemic we face today is mainly caused by the nature of the coronavirus to spread, this simulation will be somewhat applicable to the real world. Until then, stay home and continue your sanitation habits.
